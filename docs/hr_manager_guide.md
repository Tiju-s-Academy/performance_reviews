# Performance Reviews Module - HR Manager Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Performance Reviews module! This comprehensive guide is designed for HR Managers who have full access to all features and data within the system. The Performance Reviews module consists of three main components:

1. **Roles, Responsibilities and Expectations (RRE)**
2. **Continuous Performance Engagement (CPE)**
3. **360° Feedback**

As an HR Manager, you have additional capabilities beyond those of regular managers and employees, including access to all records and the ability to reset documents to draft status when necessary.

## Getting Started

1. Log in to your Odoo account
2. Click on the "Performance Reviews" application from the main menu
3. You will see the main dashboard with three menu items under "Reviews": RREs, CPEs, and 360° Feedback
4. As an HR Manager, you also have access to the "HR Dashboard" menu which provides consolidated views

## HR Dashboard

The HR Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of all performance reviews across the organization.

### Managing User Access

   - **Employee Group**: Base access to own records
   - **Manager Group**: Access to direct reports' records
   - **HR Manager Group**: Full access to all records

### Data Management Best Practices

1. Regularly audit the system to ensure data quality
2. Archive outdated records to maintain system performance
3. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations by controlling access to sensitive information

## Reporting and Analysis

### Creating Performance Reports

1. Use the grouping and filtering options to create ad-hoc reports
2. Export data for further analysis or reporting to executive management
3. Track completion rates and timeline adherence

### Identifying Trends

1. Monitor common challenges mentioned in CPEs
2. Track progression of employee performance over time
3. Identify departments or teams that may need additional support

## Best Practices for HR Managers

1. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Always respect the confidentiality of performance data
2. **Ensure Process Consistency**: Monitor that managers are following the established review processes
3. **Provide Training**: Offer training to managers and employees on how to effectively use the system
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review the quality of feedback to ensure it is specific, constructive, and actionable
5. **Process Improvement**: Collect feedback from users to continually improve the performance review process

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Access Issues**: If a user reports they cannot access expected features, verify their security group assignment
2. **Email Notifications**: If users are not receiving email notifications, check their email settings in Odoo
3. **Reset Functionality**: If the Reset to Draft button doesn't appear, ensure the user has HR Manager rights
